    <h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Introduction</h1>   
    <br> 
  
    <p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">
    We used a spotify dataset that had measurements of explicitiness, danceability,energy,loudness, speechiness, acousticness,<br> and instrumentalness. 
  We wanted to predict what goes into make a song popular or not. We started with comparing the <br>correlation between all the components and used the ones that compared highest with popularity. </p>
    
  <h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Conclusion</h1>    
    <br> 
  
    <p style="color:white;font-size:18px;"> In our conclusion we see that energy and danceability were the two main components that go into making a song popular,<br> 
    and we also found out that loudness was on of the components that made a song less likely to be popular<br>
   1.  Acousticness has decreased significantly since 1940 to today's type of music.<br>
2. Danceability was one of the variables that stayed most consistent throughout our timeline.<br>
3. Energy seems to be inversely related to Acousticness: It was very low in the first part of the century, but then rose significantly after 1960. It looks like it increased even more after 2000 as well.<br>
  </p> 
<br>
<h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Model Type</h1>   
<br> 

<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;"> We used a linear model regression to predict our data because it was one <br> of the best fits for this model considering
we have multiple component that <br> we wanted to compare. We tested danceability and energy and the came out<br> with the highest results with the value of 73%. </p> 

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
 - Danceability = 73%<br> 
- Energy = 73%<br> 
- Acousticness =55% <br>
- Loudness = 65% <br>
- Explictiness =  7% <br> </p>

  <h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Hypothesis</h1>   
<br> 
<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;"> Our hypothesis was that the songâ€™s popularity was dependent on the audio features, such the tempo,loudness,acuostiness<br>  etc; but one thing that we did not include in our training dataset is the lyrics.<br> 
That could perhaps be another area to involve for the future to improve the machine learning models.</p>
