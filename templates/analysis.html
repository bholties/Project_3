    Conclusion

  <p> In our conclusion we see that energy and danceability were the two main components that go into making a song popular, 
    and we also found out that loudness was on of the components that made a song less likely to be popular</p> 
<br>
Model Type

<p> We used a linear model regression to predict our data because it was one of the best fit for this model considerin
g we have multiple component that we wanted to compare</p> 

<br>

<p> Our hypothesis was that the songâ€™s popularity was dependent on the audio features, such the tempo,loudness,acuostiness and 
all the other ones
but one thing that we did not include in our training dataset is the lyrics. 
That could perhaps be another area to involve for the future to improve the machine learning models.</p>
