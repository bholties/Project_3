    <h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Introduction</h1>   
    <br> 
  
    <p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">
    We used a spotify dataset that had measurements of explicitiness, danceability,energy,loudness, speechiness, acousticness,<br> and instrumentalness. 
  We wanted to predict what goes into make a song popular or not. </p>
    
  <h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Conclusion</h1>    
    <br> 
  
    <p style="color:black;font-size:18px;"> In our conclusion we see that energy and danceability were the two main components that go into making a song popular,<br> 
    and we also found out that loudness was on of the components that made a song less likely to be popular<br> 
  </p> 
<br>
<h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Model Type</h1>   
<br> 

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;"> We used a linear model regression to predict our data because<br> it was one of the best fit for this model considering
we have multiple component that we wanted to compare</p> 
<br> 
<br>

<h1 style="color:black;font-size:24px;">Hypothesis</h1>   
<br> 

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;"> Our hypothesis was that the songâ€™s popularity was dependent on the audio features, such the tempo,loudness,acuostiness<br> 
and all the other onesbut one thing that we did not include in our training dataset is the lyrics.<br> 
That could perhaps be another area to involve for the future to improve the machine learning models.</p>
